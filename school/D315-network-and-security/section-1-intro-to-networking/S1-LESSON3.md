## Lesson 3.2: TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP model is about making network connectivity available. OSI is conceptual, wheras the TCP/IP is based on the actual connection stack. 

TCP/IP model is about making netowrk connectivity more available.


* TCP/IP model fundamentals:
    + Recognize that the TCP/IP model is a practical framework, used extensively in real-world applications. Understanding its historical development and role in modern networking is crucial. 
    + Do not confuse the TCP/IP model with the OSI model. While they are related, they have different structures and purposes. 
* Layer-by-layer examination: 
    + The TCP/IP model has four layers, which are distinct from the OSI model's seven layers. Pay attention to the functionality and protocols associated with each layer. 
    + The names of the layers can be used interchangeably with newer and older terminology. Be sure to know both names for each layer.

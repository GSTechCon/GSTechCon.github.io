# Lesson 3: Cloud and Wireless Security

## Lesson 3.1: Data Security: Classification, Protection, and Access Control

Data classification dictates how an organization will handle and secure the various types of data that are moved and stored throughout its network.

This video introduces various access control models used in network security, guiding how to assign permissions to users effectively. Key models explained include

* discretionary access control (DAC)
* role-based access control (RBAC)
* attribute-based access control (ABAC)
* rule-based access control
* context-based access control (CBAC)

malicious code protection tools, including antivirus, firewalls, anti-spyware, and intrusion detection systems. You want to have a multilayer defense and numerous types of defenses working together to defend against known security concerns. There is not just one way to defend against malicious code, but knowing about the more common protections is important.

## Lesson 3.2: Encryption: Data at Rest and Data in Transit

This page provides an in-depth exploration of cryptographic techniques, discussing their roles in securing information systems. It covers various cryptographic methods, including key management, and their applications in maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in digital communications.

Cryptography protects messages by transforming them into a form that is only readable by authorized users. This is accomplished using encryption. You will learn about the two general categories of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric.

Data at rest are data that are currently not being used. Data in transit are data that are be uploaded, downloaded, or synchronized over a network. Regardless of the state, data need to be protected.

## Lesson 3.3: Application Security, Access Control, and Network Security

Understanding Chapter 9 from Fundamentals of Information Systems Security is crucial because it

provides comprehensive insights into the management and execution of secure IT operations, which is essential for maintaining organizational security; 
explains the key roles and responsibilities in security administration, helping you understand the practical aspects of implementing security measures; 
highlights best practices and procedures in security operations, which are pivotal in protecting information assets against threats and vulnerabilities; and 
offers knowledge critical for aspiring or current IT security professionals, enhancing their capability to oversee and improve an organization's security posture.

The video focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in cloud models, particularly the hybrid model. It also stresses the importance of training for all levels of staffâ€”from end-users to programmersâ€”in recognizing and mitigating internal and external security threats

## Lesson 3.4: Cloud Security

Chapter 6 of Fundamentals of Information Systems Security focuses on access controlsâ€”a crucial aspect of information security. It is valuable because it introduces and explains the four parts of access control, differentiates between physical and logical access controls, and details the methods and guidelines for identification, authentication, and authorization in security systems. This chapter also addresses the importance of accountability in access control and provides insights into formal models of access control, enhancing your understanding of how to protect information systems from unauthorized access and threats. Understanding these concepts is fundamental for anyone pursuing a career in information security, making this chapter an essential resource for students in this field. 

## Lesson 3.5: Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Security Protocols

## Lesson 3.6: Wireless Network Infrastructure Modes

## Lesson 3.7: Security Standards

## Lesson 3.8: Wireless Attack Types

## Tips and Tricks

* Take the Pre-Assessment immediately upon starting a class. It will give you insights into how the class is structured, what you can skip because you already know it, and what kinds of questions the Assessment may contain.
* Check the Course Tips, Announcements, and Chatter for tips from the Mentors and fellow students.
* One of the best things you can do is to search your course number on the subreddit or simply on Google. Typically, there will be plenty of course specific resources and study tips from other students.

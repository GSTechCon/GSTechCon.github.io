## Lesson 2.3: Encryption Techniques and Methods

Encyption is essentially the process of scrambling data unless someone has the key.

* encryption scrambles data
* key needed to unscramble
* data at rest or in transit
* symmetric vs. asymmetric

Encrypting data in transit means, when data is transmitted across a network, it is encrypted before. Plaintext is encrypted using an encryption algorithm.

Understanding the use of encryption in data protection is crucial for you in the field of cybersecurity or data management. Encryption is a key method for securing data, ensuring that it remains confidential and inaccessible.

Two kinds of methods

### Encryptions

Two main types:

* should be strong (min strength requires 256 bits)
* multifactor authentication
    + vastly reduces risk of data breaches

public and private keys

* over the Internet, it typically means users won't have to deal with the keys, data is transmitted, and cannot be tampered with
* MFA

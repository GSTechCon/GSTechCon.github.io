---

## Lesson 1.1: Security Policies

## Lesson 1.2: Design Principles

## Lesson 1.3: Least Privilege

This lesson provides an in-depth explanation of the principles of least prvilege in cybersecurity - focusing on granting minimal neccesary permission to users and applications, limiting access based on tasks and time, the importance of structuring security levels to minimize exposure and risk.

* start with no privileges
* time based
* only what's needed

Keeps data confidential and secret. Ensures users that don't require highers of information have access and inadvertantly provide said information.

## Lesson 1.4: Fail-Safe Defaults

Design principle of fail safe. When a system experiences a failure. It should fail to a safe state. In a way that does not compromise security.

* Exceptions
    + Exceptions are not errors
    + have specific handling requirements
* errors
    + mistakes or faults
    + human error
    + errors have specific handling requirements

Error/Exception handling are handled in a predictable and acceptable way. One failsafe principle

### Explicit Deny

* deny by default
* non-verbose
    + error codes
    + error IDs
    + more comprehensive that won't help an average user

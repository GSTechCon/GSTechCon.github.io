# Section 1: Introduction to Networking Concepts



* **Lesson 1: What Is a Network**: Learn the fundamentals of networking, exploring how individual devices come together to share, collaborate, and create the networks that enable modern communication. 
* **Lesson 2: Network Commands**: Command your way through the technical complexities with hands-on learning of essential network commands that form the everyday toolkit of network troubleshooters. 
* **Lesson 3: Networking Standards and Models**: Navigate the blueprint of networking protocols and modelsâ€”such as the OSI and TCP/IP modelsâ€”and gain an understanding of how these standards are essential for creating harmonious, universal communication systems. 
* **Lesson 4: Fundamentals of Virtual and Cloud Computing**: Demystify cloud computing, revealing how virtualization transforms physical resources into flexible, scalable, and accessible services. 

## Build Employability Skills and Competence

**Cloud Solution Identification**: Identify various cloud solutions for business problems. 
**Networking Concepts Explanation**: Explain fundamental networking concepts. 
**Describe Networking Technologies**: Describe primary networking technologies. 
**Basic Troubleshooting**: Implement basic troubleshooting. 
**Networking Hardware Comparison**: Compare different networking hardware technologies. 

## Prepare for the Assessment

To prepare for the objective assessment, ask yourself these questions: 

* Can I identify network technology concepts, given a scenario? 
* Can I identify the network commands used for troubleshooting on Windows and Linux systems? 
* Given a network device, service, or function, can I select the corresponding Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) or TCP/IP layer? 
* Given a scenario, can I identify the type of virtual and cloud computing solution being used?

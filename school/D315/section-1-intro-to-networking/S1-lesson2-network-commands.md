**Cybersecurity Threats**

First, you will define threat; a threat is anything that exploits vulnerabilities or bugs in a system or application. Next, you will look at the meaning of threat actor; a threat actor is an entity responsible for a threat. Then, you will explore attack vectors; these are any methods used to launch the threat actor. Finally, you will define target; this is the goal of the threat actor.

**Attack Types** and **Common Security Threats**

## Information Security Terms

**Spoofing** - This is a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker impersonates the sender and receiver of
the traffic. The server unknowingly exchanges information with the attacker, believing they are the client, then the attacker forwards the information to the client so nobody notices a break in connection.
**Wiretapping** - This form of attack can include putting special taps in-line with a computerâ€™s network cable and
then using a packet sniffer to listen and record the traffic on the network.
**Social Engineering** - This is the act of manipulating human trust to gain access or information. Examples include
impersonation and phishing.
**Poor Physical Security Measures** - If an attacker gains access to your files or to your physical computers, the attacker can simply steal a copy of the data and crack encryption at their own pace
